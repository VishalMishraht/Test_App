Git stores the complete history of your files for a project in a special directory
 (a.k.a. a folder) called a repository, or repo. Keeping an entire history sounds expensive,
  but it isn't, because git is smart and does not replicate all your files, and instead keeps
 only changes to your files. ...


 A version Control system is a system that maintains different versions of your project when we work
  in a team or as an individual. (system managing changes to files) As the project progresses,
   new features get added to it. 
So a version control system maintains all your different versions of your project for you and you can 
rollback to any version you want without causing any trouble to you for maintaining different 
versions by giving names to it like MyProject, MyProjectWithFeature1, etc.
